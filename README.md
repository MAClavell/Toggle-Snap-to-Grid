# Toggle Snap to Grid
A module for Foundry VTT that lets you disable a grid snapping for tokens with a UI button. Helpful for RP maps!
* A button will appear on the token UI when right clicking. Press it to toggle grid snapping on and off.
* If grid snapping is off you can hold shift to temporarily turn grid snapping back on.

## Drag Ruler Support
This module supports [Drag Ruler](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-drag-ruler) and changes the ruler's measurement type based on if grid snapping is enabled. When Drag Ruler is installed an option will appear in the settings menu: 
* Choose how you want measurements and highlighting to look when dragging an unsnapped token. This option is client specific so all players can choose what best fits them.
